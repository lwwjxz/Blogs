1. 状语2和谓语不能是句子，其他的部分都有可能是句子。      
1. 主语或者宾语是句子的时候就是名词从句。     
1. That you love her is a lie.  主语从句连接此不能丢。    
    头重脚轻所以英文中经常写为:It is a lie that you love her.(形式主语)         
1. I think that she is pretty.  宾语从句能省略连接词。     
    I think she is pretty.        
    I think:she is pretty.    
1. Where you are from is a secret.   are不能提前到you前面，因为英语中把谓语提前表达疑问，而此处很明显不是疑问。      
1. What your name is is a secret.  两个is是连着的。     
1. Tom, my brother, is coming.  同位语tom就是我哥，是同一个人所以用is。          
1. Tom and my brother are coming.   tom和我哥是不同的两个人。        
1. 同位语从句: She hates the idea that we should abandon her. 容易跟定语从句混淆  She hates the idea that you told her. 抽象名词经常要用同位语从句。      
1. 人名翻译成汉语形式   音译结果+（英文名）。          
1. 反问    
    1. You are right , are't you ?  
    1. She can do it, can't she ?   
1. 宾语从句的反问:(一般对主语进行反问，主语是我或者我们时对从反问，因为逻辑上我们不能反问自己)      
    I never thought that he would come for the party,would he(从句的反问)?        
    She never thought we were wrong, did she（主句的反问）?       
1. 疑问代词what/which/where/why既能起连接作用又能充当成分(疑问代词)，that只能充当连接词。
